How to produce the credentialprovider.h
=======================================

The credentials provider header file has been generated from the IDL file
provided in the Windows SDK

Which can be retrieved from this (ca 1.4 GiB) ISO:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18950

The IDL file is located on the ISO in /Setup/WinSDKBuild/cab2.cab and is called
credentialprovider.idl

The header file has been generated on Fedora with help of the following packags:

- wine-devel
- mingw-w64-tools

The command to produce the header file from the IDL file is the following:
$ x86_64-w64-mingw32-widl -I /usr/include/wine/windows/ -h ./credentialprovider.idl -o credentialprovider.h
